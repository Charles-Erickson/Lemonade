# Lemonade
Lemonade Stand game
Within my Lemonade Stand Project there is a representation of the Single Responsibility Principle(S.R.P) inside the Weather Class.
You can witness it in the FindGameWeather method which takes in the outside int of the random weather number.
The only purpose of this is to return a type of weather. Either Sunny, Cloudy, Foggy, or Rainy.
Another example of SOLID design is in the Customer Class.  The Open/Closed principle of design.  
The WantToBuy Method shows that the result of the method is set but the added extensions that are entered into the method
are abstract and open to modification.
